# Pizza Bill Generator:

In a pizza cafe there are two types of pizzas, regular and deluxe, and both come in their veg and non-veg variants with a base price. You can ask to add extra cheese or toppings, if you want, on your regular pizza. Deluxe Pizza comes with extra cheese and toppings by default. Also, if you want a takeaway, you have to pay for the paper bag that comes with it.
In the end the bill is to be generated.

Veg pizza base price = 300\
Non-veg pizza base price = 400\
Extra Cheese Price = 80\
Extra Toppings For Veg Pizza = 70\
Extra Toppings For Non-veg Pizza = 120\
Paper bag Price = 20

**Bill Structure Example:**\
Example 1:\
Base Price Of The Pizza: 300\
Extra Cheese Added: 80\
Extra Toppings Added: 70\
Paperbag Added: 20\
Total Price: 470

Example 2:\
Base Price Of The Pizza: 400\
Extra Cheese Added: 80\
Extra Toppings Added: 120\
Total Price: 600

**Note:**\
Even if the customer asks for extra cheese or toppings by invoking the method multiple times, it is not to be added in the bill multiple times.\
The extra cheese is added before the extra toppings if the customer asks for both, and the same is reflected in the billing.
